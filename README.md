# msrecruiter: Military Spouse Finder

## Why create this app?
Because we want everyone to hire military spouses and understand that those spouses are likely to hide their military affiliation, we are creating this tool to more easily
identify milspouse resumes. Keyword searches do not help identify hidden spouses, so a data set of resumes is necessary to make this tool truly beneficial.

## Purpose
This app is meant to search a selected directory of PDF resumes for those with keywords that likely identify a military spouse. Tasks to be completed:
1. make the weighting prediction less arbitrary
2. complete the GUI -- initial definition of done will list filenames only
3. locate a data set of US and international resumes representative of job candidates in US jobs, to be used to create a machine learning model for smarter prediction

## FAQ
What if someone uses this to filter out milspouses?  
Do you want to work for an employer who would eliminate you if they knew you were a milspouse? Didn't think so.

Can I contribute?  
Fork away! We'll continue to make changes to it here, but we will consider a pull request, especially if it comes from a milso.

What's a milso?  
Military significant other. Usually a spouse, sometimes not.
